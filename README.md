![Preview Gif](/Animation/animation.gif)

### Libararies Used:
1. Streamlit
2. Numpy
3. Pandas
4. Matplotlib
5. math
6. random
7. turtles

### Key features:
#### 1. Browse Section:
* Upload a signal 
* Control the sample frequency
* Add noise to the signal (SNR ratio from 0 -> 1)
* Reconstruct the signal according to [Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem)

#### 2. Signal Generator:
* Add a signal by Frequency or Amplitude (1 -> 10)
* Delete a signal by Frequency or Amplitude (1 -> 10)
* Add noise to the generated signal (SNR ratio from 0 -> 1)
* Reconstruct the signal according to [Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem)
* Download a CSV file of the frequencies and amplitudes of the generated signal
